# Experiment 3 — provider coverage (real-data-verified)

> Pressure-test the host-agnostic claim by adding **more real providers** — Claude Code and Gemini proved the core works across two shapes; this extends it to Codex and OpenCode, each validated against **wire data the host actually produced**, not docs or hand-written fixtures.

## Hypothesis

The host-agnostic core (normalized `Event` → OTel spans) accepts any host's session format behind a thin adapter. If true, adding Codex and OpenCode is *just another adapter each*, with **zero core changes** — and we can prove it on real output, not assert it.

## The honesty rule (why this experiment is shaped this way)

Building an adapter from a vendor's docs and testing it against a fixture *we* wrote is circular — it proves "we can read JSON we invented," not "we read real Codex/OpenCode output." So for each provider: **install the real CLI → run one real session → build the adapter against the actual wire data → capture it for real.** Fixtures are then derived from the confirmed real shape (for hermetic regression), and the real capture is the verification.

## Status

| Provider | Format | Verified against real data | Capture |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Codex** | `~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl` — `{timestamp,type,payload}`; `session_meta`, `response_item` (message / `function_call` / `function_call_output`, flat by `call_id`), `event_msg` | ✅ a real `codex exec` session | rich — `session → turn → tool`, real durations |
| **OpenCode** | `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` — **SQLite** (`session`/`message`/`part` tables; `data` columns are JSON), read via built-in `node:sqlite` (zero-dep) | ⏳ pending one real `opencode run` session | — |

Adapters live with the others in [`../experiment-1-trace-capture/adapters/`](../experiment-1-trace-capture/adapters/) and register in `registry.mjs`; the core was **not touched** — that's the agnosticity result.

## Codex findings (verified)

- Turns come from `event_msg/user_message` (clean prompt text) — *not* the `response_item/message role:developer|user` entries, which include injected `<permissions instructions>` / `<environment_context>` noise.
- Tool spans pair `function_call` ↔ `function_call_output` by **`call_id`** (flat, not nested) → real durations. Confirmed on a live `codex exec "list the files…"`: `session → turn → exec_command (79ms)`.
- Codex tool output carries **no explicit error flag** in the sample, so tool status defaults to `OK` (a refinement once we see a failing call).

## OpenCode notes

- v1.16.2 stores sessions in **SQLite**, not JSON files (the migration the docs mention has happened). `session`/`message`/`part` tables with JSON `data` blobs.
- `node:sqlite` (built-in, Node ≥22, no flag on Node 25) reads it → still zero external deps.
- Needs a real `opencode run` session to confirm the `message.data`/`part.data` JSON shapes before the adapter is trustworthy (in progress).
